About the project:
This is simple tv shows app. On the homepage you see some popular shows displayed by genre.
When you click on the show you are able to see some more details about it.
As well you can search for shows by using search field in the header.

To create this app I have used vue.js framework as this is one og my favourite frameworks.
I think it works really well for creating this sort of prototype/test app, but is a good choice for a bigger apps as well.

I have used vue cli to build the project. It is great tool which helps to speedup configuration of the project and adding packages.
I have't use any ui-frameworks or boilerplate templates.
I have installed couple additional packages:

vue-horizontal to create shows-slider on the homepage
vue-fontawesome for icons
vuex to manage state
vue-router for navigation

node -v 12.2.0
